# weather.app

## Weather wep application using the API provided by ![OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

### Features: 
    - Search by city;
    - App retrieves the searched city weather information provided by the API.
    
### Technical Notes:

This was a simple implementation with the core purpose of using the async capabilities of fetch/catch and promises. The API returns a parsed JSON file which then is used as the source for the extraction of the required information that is then copied to a new Object and rendered on the screen upon the API being called.
